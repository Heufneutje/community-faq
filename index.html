    <h1>Getting Started with the Desert Bus IRC Chat Room</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the Desert Bus IRC room!  You're in a very exciting place.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a>,
        however, can be daunting to newcomers, so we're here to help get you
        set up and allow you to have the most enjoyable Desert Bus experience
        possible!</p>
    <p>In order for us to be able to give you information most appropriately,
        you must choose your path:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="clients/jircs.html">I've never heard of IRC before!  I want
            something that's already set up and lets me get right to the
            chatting and/or bidding.</a></li>
        <li><a href="clients/jircs.html">I have heard of IRC before, but I still
            prefer something that's already set up.</a></li>
        <li><a href="clients">I use or would like to get my own IRC client.
            What settings do I need to use your network?</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Or ask a question:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="account.html">Why should I have a Desert Bus Donor
            account?</a></li>
        <li><a href="bidserv.html">How do I bid in a live auction?</a></li>
    </ul>
