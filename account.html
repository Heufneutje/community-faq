	<h1>Desert Bus Donor Accounts</h1>
	<p>A donor account affords you many opportunities, including glorious fame
		and fortune!<br>
		OK, so they're not <strong>that</strong> great, but there are still
		benefits you get with a donor account that you can't get without:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Your donations can be tracked to your account, so if you win a
			giveaway, for example, it's much easier to find the person who won
			and send the prize right to them.</li>
		<li>You can't bid in an auction (either type&mdash;live or silent!)
			without one!  Many of the best prizes each year go up for auction.
			Make sure you at least have a shot&mdash;
			<a href="https://desertbus.org/donor/sign-up">sign up for a donor
			account!</a>  (If you want some of the more popular prizes, it helps
			if you're the richest person ever.)</li>
		<li>Recognition as a donor: you get voiced in the IRC chat room.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Signing up for a donor account is easy.  All we ask is that you give us
		your email address and a password you will use to access your donor
		account.  That's it!  We don't require any further information from you
		for the account itself.  We only require any further information on an
		as-needed basis.  (For example, we'll ask you to enter your address if
		we need to ship you something, of course.)</p>
