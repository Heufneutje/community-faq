	<h1>Using BidServ</h1>
	<p>It's auction time!  How do I bid?  What's even going on?  This page is
		here to answer your BidServ-related questions.</p>
	<p>You can tell BidServ that you want to bid or ask it about the current
		state of the auction by giving commands.  These commands will go to
		BidServ.  BidServ will act on your bid or give you the information you
		desire in response.  The following commands are available:</p>
	<table id="bidserv-commands">
		<tr><th>Command</th><th>Syntax</th><th>Details</th></tr>
		<tr>
			<td>BID</td>
			<td class="explain-syntax">/bid ###.## [smack talk]</td>
			<td>This command will place a bid.  <strong>Do not use this command
				unless you really want to bid.  Fake bids are taken seriously
				and may result in permanent removal from the IRC channel, or
				worse.</strong>  In place of the ###.##, just fill in your bid
				amount.  You may optionally include smack talk after your bid,
				which will be displayed prominently for all to see.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>HIGHBIDDER</td>
			<td class="explain-syntax">/highbidder</td>
			<td>This command shows you who has the highest bid in the current
				auction, along with what that bid is.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>CURRENTAUCTION</td>
			<td class="explain-syntax">/currentauction</td>
			<td>Did you just join the channel?  Are you otherwise totally lost
				as to what is going on?  This command will tell you what item
				is currently up for auction.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<p class="note-important">Note: In some clients, you may, when using the
		commands listed above, be told that the commands do not exist.  This is
		because your client blocks commands it assumes do not exist.  They do,
		in fact, exist.  You'll need to execute these commands by using /quote
		or /raw before the command; e.g. '/quote bid' instead of '/bid'.</p>
