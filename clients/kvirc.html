    <h1>Using KVIrc to Access the Desert Bus Chat</h1>

    <h2 id="initialsetup">Setting up KVIrc the First Time</h2>
    <p>If you're running the client for the first time, you'll want to set up
        a default nickname and ident (username).  Navigate to
        <span class="itemdetail">Settings > Configure KVIrc...</span> and open
        the Identity section:</p>
    <img src="images/kvirc/settings_identity.png"
        alt="Navigate to the Identity section">
    <p>You'll want to fill in a default Nickname, Username, and Real name.
        This doesn't have to be your actual real name.  You may put in whatever
        you like for these fields.  Realize that the nick and the username
        cannot contain spaces.  The rest of the fields here and in the other
        tabs in the Identity section are optional.  You may fill them out if you
        wish.</p>
    <h2>Setting Up the Desert Bus IRC Network</h2>
    <p>Before you get connected, you'll want to set up the server connection.
        This allows you to save the server to easily connect to it in the future
        or set it up to automatically connect when you start the client.  This
        process consists of setting up the network and the server, and
        optionally also consists of setting up to automatically connect to the
        network and setting up autoidentification to your Desert Bus Donor
        Account.</p>
    <h3 id="networksetup">Network Setup</h3>
    <p>To do this, go to <span class="itemdetail">Settings > Configure
        Servers...</span>.  When the dialog opens, click the New Network icon:
        </p>
    <img src="images/kvirc/new_network.png" alt="KVIrc New Network Icon">
    <p>This creates and automatically selects an entry titled "New Network."
        Type in an appropriate name in the box below (e.g. "Desert Bus").</p>
    <h3 id="autoconnect">Autoconnect</h3>
    <p>If you'd like to automatically connect to the network when you start
        KVIrc, click on the <span class="itemdetail">Advanced...</span> button
        and check the box marked <span class="itemdetail">Connect to this
        network at startup</span>.</p>
    <img src="images/kvirc/autoconnect.png"
        alt="Autoconnect to Desert Bus Chat">
    <p>No further settings must be adjusted.  The empty boxes will pull the
        default nickname/username information you already entered from the
        global settings.</p>
    <h3 id="serversetup">Server Setup</h3>
    <p>With the new network created, click the "New Server" icon:</p>
    <img src="images/kvirc/new_server.png" alt="KVIrc New Server Icon">
    <p>A server called "irc.unknown.net" will be created and automatically
        selected.  In the box at the bottom of the dialog box, change the name
        to <span class="formentry">irc.desertbus.org</span> and click on the
        <span class="itemdetail">Advanced...</span> button.</p>
    <p>The first tab that opens is the identity tab.  All of these boxes can be
        left blank; unless you change them, they will pull in the information
        from your default nickname/username settings, which you already set up.
        </p>
    <p>If you would rather connect using SSL, navigate to the Connection tab.
        Set the port to <span class="formentry">6697</span> and check the
        <span class="itemdetail">Use SSL Protocol</span> box.</p>
    <img src="images/kvirc/enable_ssl.png" alt="Enabling SSL">
    <h3 id="autoidentify">Automatically Identify To Your Donor Account</h3>
    <p>If you have a <a href="https://www.desertbus.org/donor">Desert Bus Donor
        Account, you will want to set up automatic</a> identification so that
        you are automatically identified to your account when you connect and
        can easily take advantage of the benefits being identified will give you
        (being able to bid, etc.) without going through more hassle later.  In
        order to do this, navigate to the <span class="itemdetail">Advanced
        </span> tab of the server setup.  In order to auto-identify, you need to
        check the <span class="itemdetail">Query extended capabilities on
        connect</span> and the <span class="itemdetail">Authenticate via SASL
        extension</span> boxes.  Your <span class="itemdetail">Sasl Nickname
        </span> is the email address you use to log into your Donor Account, and
        your <span class="itemdetail">Sasl Password</span> is your Donor Account
        password.</p>

        alt="Autoidentify to your Donor Account">
    <h2 id="finishing">Finishing Up</h2>
    <p>You're done setting up!  Click <span class="itemdetail">OK</span> in your
        Server Details dialog, and then click the giant blue
        <span class="itemdetail">Connect Now</span> button.  The server is set
        up, and you're now connected to the chat!</p>
    <p>To connect in the future (unless you set up autoconnect), find the
        <span class="itemdetail">Desert Bus</span> (or whatever you named it)
        server in the server tree on the left side of your screen, select it,
        and click the <span class="itemdetail">Connect</span> button on the top.

    <h2 id="hidejoinpart">Hiding Joins and Parts in #desertbus</h2>
    <p>Desert Bus is a crazy time.  Lots of people go in and out of the channel,
        and all the join/part notices can get in the way of the chatting going
        on.  You can move non-messages (joins, parts, mode changes, etc.) to a
        separate pane from the conversation by clicking the
        <span class="itemdetail">Split View</span> icon on the top-right of the
        window.  This moves joins/parts/etc. out of the way of text.  You may
        shrink the joins/parts/etc. pane to focus on the conversation.</p>
