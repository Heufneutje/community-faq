	<h1>Desert Bus Webchat</h1>
	<p>We've put in a lot of work so that you don't have to.  Our jIRCs
		webclient allows you to connect to our chat quickly and easily.
		It's also integrated with our website, so that you automatically log
		into your account in the chat if you're already logged into our website.
		It's also integrated into our bidding system, bringing you real-time
		data about ongoing auctions right to your seeing holes.</p>
	<h2>That sounds the best ever!  How do I get in on this?</h2>
	<p>Simple!</p>
	<ol>
		<li><span class="stepheader">Log into your donor account.</span>
			This step isn't strictly required, but it is recommended, and you
			should definitely do this step if you have a donor account.  You
			must do this if you plan to bid in a live auction.  For more on
			this, see <a href="../account.html">Why should I log in with my donor
			account?</a></li>
		<li><span class="stepheader">Navigate yourself over to
			<a href="http://desertbus.org/live/chat">our chat page</a> and
			choose a chat nickname.</li>
		<li><span class="stepheader">
			<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UoNB_yuQTc">Use my
			toothpaste.</a></span>  It's just that easy!</li>
	</ol>
	<p>At this point, you should be in the room and chatting happily!
		If you're planning to participate in a live auction, see
		<a href="../bidserv.html">Using BidServ</a>.
